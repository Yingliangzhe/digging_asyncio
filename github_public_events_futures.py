Creating concurrency
So far we’ve been using a single method of creating and retrieving results from coroutines,
creating a set of tasks and waiting for all of them to finish.

But coroutines can be scheduled to run or retrieve their results in different ways.
Imagine a scenario where we need to process the results of the HTTP GET requests as soon as they arrive, t
he process is actually quite similar than in our previous example:

The code in this case is only slightly different, we’re gathering the coroutines into a list,
each of them ready to be scheduled and executed.
The as_completed function returns an iterator that will yield a completed future as they come in.
Now don’t tell me that’s not cool. By the way, as_completed is originally from the concurrent.futures module.
